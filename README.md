Academic Adventure is a simple 2D game project I created for my undergraduate C++ course. 
The game has a straightforward story: Itâ€™s Sunday, and you return home only to realize that you need to submit a school project on Teams. 
Unfortunately, the project is on your USB drive, which you left at the university. Your task is to head to campus and retrieve your files, but be cautious of what might happen along the way!
