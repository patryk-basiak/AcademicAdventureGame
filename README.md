# 🎓 Academic Adventure Game

**Academic Adventure Game** is an interactive, text-based C++ adventure that makes learning fun and engaging. Players embark on a quirky and challenging journey filled with mini-games, puzzles, and unexpected encounters — all in pursuit of retrieving a forgotten assignment.

## 🧩 Plot

It’s a lazy Sunday afternoon. You're ready to relax — maybe play some video games — when suddenly you hear a *Microsoft Teams* notification. It’s a message about an assignment... due **today**.

Panic kicks in. You remember completing it... but you left it on your USB drive, which is still at the **university**.

Thus begins your epic, slightly absurd journey back to school. You’ll:

- Navigate through chaotic streets (watch out for cars!),
- Face quirky enemies and weird obstacles,
- Solve mini-games and puzzles,
- Make choices that influence the gameplay later on.

It's a light-hearted adventure that might remind you of your dad's stories of *how he traveled to his school"* 😉
